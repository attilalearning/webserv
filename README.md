## Instructions

Run the 42 tester:

1. make (to compile the webserv binary in ./bin/webserv)
2. run:
   
   ./bin/webserv config/42tester.conf (to start the webserv)
   
3. from a separate terminal, run:
   
   ./tests/42tester http://localhost:8080

   And follow the instructions (just hit ENTER) as everything
   is configured as asked (www_42tester has the needed files
   and directories, and conf/42tester.conf has the needed
   configuration)
